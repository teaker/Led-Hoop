Led-Hoop
========

Final HulaHoop Code (Sparkfun Pro Micro + LPD8806)

Credit and MANY thanks to Philihp for the foundational code and instructions:  http://philihp.com/blog/2011/diy-led-hula-hoop/


I merely modified the code to:

1) use the arduino's built-in pull-up resistor
2) add effects

Its late.  I'll update this readme soon.
