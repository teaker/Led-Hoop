Led-Hoop
========

Final HulaHoop Code (Sparkfun Pro Micro + LPD8806)

Credit and MANY thanks to Philihp for the foundational code and instructions:  http://philihp.com/blog/2011/diy-led-hula-hoop/


I merely modified the code to:

1) use the arduino's built-in pull-up resistor
2) add effects
3) add colors

I also used different components than Philihp used, including:

1) Sparkfun pro micro (instead of adruino mini)
2) 1x4 membrane keypad - http://www.adafruit.com/products/1332 (instead of tactile switches).
3) USB LiPo charger - https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10401  (instead of charger/power plug/receptacle).  My main reason for doing this was so that I could use any mini-usb cable hooked into an iPhone/iPod wall-wart to charge the hoop.


Its late.  I'll update this readme soon.
